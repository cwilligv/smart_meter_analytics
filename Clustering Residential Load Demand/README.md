## Clustering Residential Load Demand with Data Mining Techniques.

This project investigates the half-hourly electricity consumption patterns of 300 residential customers with solar PV systems in New South Wales, Australia, using a Data Mining techniques. The objective is to segment customers into distinct groups based on their consumption behaviour to support the design and implementation of targeted demand-side management (DSM) initiatives.

### Data Source and Scope

- The dataset, sourced from Ausgrid's Solar Home Electricity project, spans one year (July 1, 2010, to June 30, 2011) and includes general consumption (GC) data. 
- The raw dataset contains over 40 million records, encompassing energy consumption, controlled load, and generation intervals for 300 customers over three years. However, the analysis focuses on general consumption for one year to manage computational complexity.

### Methodology

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** 
    - The dataset is explored to understand the structure, distributions, and dimensions. 
    - Data is aggregated over different time periods (daily, monthly, seasonal, and annually), revealing key consumption patterns. 
    - Visualizations highlight periods of peak demand, seasonal variations, and weekday versus weekend differences.
2. **Feature Engineering:**
    - Four key time periods (overnight, breakfast, daytime, and evening) are defined based on observed demand patterns.
    - Seven features are engineered to capture customer consumption behaviour across these time periods, seasons, and weekday/weekend variations:
        - Relative mean power during time periods (rmp_*)
        - Mean Relative Standard Deviation (mrsd)
        - Seasonal Score (sscore)
        - Weekend vs Weekday Score (wdscore)
3. **Clustering:**
    - A Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is selected due to the Gaussian distribution observed in the engineered features.
    - The optimal number of clusters is determined by evaluating a range of cluster numbers using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and Silhouette and Davies-Boulding scores.
    - Six clusters are identified as providing the best balance between model fit and cluster separation.
4. **Cluster Profiling:**
    - Each cluster is profiled based on its distinct consumption patterns, providing insights into the behaviour of different customer segments. 

### Key Findings and Implications

- The six identified clusters represent distinct customer groups with unique energy consumption patterns.
- These profiles highlight the importance of time-of-day, seasonal, and weekday/weekend variations in electricity consumption.
- The findings provide valuable insights for developing tailored DSM strategies, such as: 
    - **Time-of-use pricing** to incentivize consumption during off-peak periods.
    - **Demand response programs** to encourage load shifting and reduce peak demand.

### Contributions and Impact

This project contributes to the understanding of residential electricity consumption patterns, particularly among customers with solar PV systems. The identified customer segments and their consumption profiles can inform the development of effective DSM initiatives by utility companies like Ausgrid, leading to a more efficient and sustainable energy future.
